\title{Fix nlmixr2 save output}
\usage{
nlmixr2saveParFixedDf(obj)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A list object returned by nlmixr2's save function.}
}
\value{
A modified data.frame object with "Estimate" and "SE" as named numeric vectors
}
\description{
This function modifies the output of nlmixr2's save function to ensure that
the "Estimate" and "SE" fields are numeric vectors with appropriate names,
rather than data frames. This is necessary for compatibility with other
functions that expect these fields to be numeric vectors.
