Description: 'nlmixr2' allows fitting and comparing nonlinear mixed-effects models in
    differential equations with flexible dosing information commonly seen
    in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (Almquist, Leander, and
    Jirstrand 2015 <doi:10.1007/s10928-015-9409-1>). Differential equation
    solving is by compiled C code provided in the 'rxode2' package (Wang,
    Hallow, and James 2015 <doi:10.1002/psp4.12052>). This package is for
    saving 'nlmixr2' in a format that can be read outside of 'nlmixr2' and is independent of
    the version of 'nlmixr2'.
